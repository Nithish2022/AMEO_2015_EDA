Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Understanding Job Market Trends

Objective:
The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to job market trends. Through data visualization, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing, the project aims to gain insights into various factors influencing salary levels, career choices, and gender preferences in the job market.

Research Questions:
Testing Salary Claim: Investigate the claim made by a Times of India article suggesting that fresh graduates in Computer Science Engineering can earn up to 2.5-3 lakhs annually if they pursue careers as Programming Analysts, Software Engineers, Hardware Engineers, or Associate Engineers.
Gender-Specialization Relationship: Explore whether there exists a relationship between an individual's gender and their choice of specialization, particularly in educational fields.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' demographics, educational backgrounds, job designations, salaries, and other relevant attributes. It provides a comprehensive view of the job market landscape, enabling detailed analysis of various factors influencing career choices and salary levels.

Analysis Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, format dates, and ensure data consistency.
Univariate Analysis: Explore individual variables to understand their distributions and characteristics.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between pairs of variables, such as gender and specialization, using visualizations and statistical tests.
Hypothesis Testing: Conduct hypothesis tests to validate or refute claims made about salary levels and other factors in the job market.
Conclusion: Summarize findings, draw insights, and make recommendations based on the analysis conducted.

Conclusion:
The EDA conducted in this project provides valuable insights into job market trends, salary distributions, and gender-specialization relationships. The findings contribute to a better understanding of factors influencing career choices and salary levels among individuals, offering useful information for career planning, education policy, and workforce development.
